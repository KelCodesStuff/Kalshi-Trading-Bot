"""
Kill Switch Integration Test

This test verifies the safety kill switch mechanism. It places a dummy 1-cent order on 
an active market, verifies that the order is tracked locally, and then triggers the 
asynchronous kill switch. It asserts that the order manager has successfully cleaned 
up and cancelled all resting quotes.
